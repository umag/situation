Implement a scrollable log window at the bottom of the TUI screen.
This window should display logs of API requests made and the responses received (both success and error).
Modify the API client calls to capture this information instead of printing it directly to stdout/stderr.
Update the TUI layout, state management, and event handling to support this new window and scrolling.
